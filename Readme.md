# Counting words
By Daan Kloetstra

This test consists of two parts. They are called part-one and part-two.

## Part one
In part one is the library for calculating the word frequency. You can test this library by running `npm run test` (make sure you run `npm i` first), this will run the unit tests.

## Part two
The front end can be found in part two. The front end uses part one. To start the front end run the command `npm run start` (make sure you run `npm i` first).

## Libraries and frameworks used
For this test I used a few libraries and frameworks. They are listed below:
- **typescript**: for typings in JavaScript;
- **mocha**: testing framework for writing unit tests;
- **react**: for building the front end;
- **craco**: to override React configuration;
- **react-app-rewire-alias**: to load Typescript modules which are outside the `src/` dir;
- **tailwind**: for front end styling.
